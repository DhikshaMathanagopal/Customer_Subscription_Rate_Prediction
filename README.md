# Customer_Subscription_Rate_Prediction
Data mining and predictive analytics project using retail customer shopping trends to enhance subscription rates.

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project focuses on using **data mining and predictive analytics** to enhance customer subscription rates in the retail sector.  
Using the **Customer Shopping Trends Dataset** from Kaggle, it explores customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and engagement patterns to predict the likelihood of subscription using machine learning techniques.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective
To build an end-to-end predictive model that identifies potential subscribers and provides data-driven insights to optimize marketing and customer retention strategies.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature Encoding and Transformation  
  - Classification using Logistic Regression, KNN, and Gaussian Naive Bayes  
  - Dimensionality Reduction with PCA  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Import and review the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Clean missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric variables.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualize data distribution, correlations, and customer behavior insights.  
4. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Transform and select key attributes influencing subscription status.  
5. **Modeling** â€“ Train multiple classifiers (KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).  
6. **Evaluation** â€“ Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
7. **Optimization** â€“ Apply PCA to improve model generalization and interpretability.

## ðŸš€ Results & Insights
- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (after PCA)  
- **Accuracy:** ~95% across validation and test sets  
- **Key Findings:**
  - Discounts and positive review ratings significantly influence subscription likelihood.  
  - Frequent shoppers and high-spending customers have a higher probability of subscribing.  
  - Seasonal trends and promotions impact conversion rates.
